# SHP to KML to MySQL

A tutorial and PHP script for converting shapefiles (SHP) to KML files which can then be parsed and turned into SQL for MySQL.

## Quick Start

1. Use [shp2kml](http://www.zonums.com/shp2kml.html) to convert the SHP file to a KML file. Select all the extended attributes you want in the final database.
2. Update the top of the PHP script with the path to your KML file.
3. Execute the PHP script.

*Woot! You have a SQL file to import into MySQL.*
